KNOWN BUGS:
- You cannot dismount from mounts. 
- There seems to be a random crash bug somewhere. 
- The ice breath from the ice lizards is invisible most of the time. 
- The first door in Archaeologist Starter does not open. 
- Snakes are harmless.
- Moving platforms move out from under your feet. 
- Colour changes to the Life Bar through enchantments seem to be permanent. 
- The Paladin spell Call Gelding only works one time. 
- The Divine Rune in Healer Starter cannot be turned off.
- I can't jump in rouge starter I just headbang. 
- Once I slaughter half of rouge starter enemies random stuff just starts becoming invisible or just dissappears completely. 
- The iron ball no longer slows me down it just teleports to me whenever the chain is extended. 
- The iron ball deletes from your hands if you walk to fast away from knife if you are holding his iron ball. 
- There seems to be an AI targeting bug. Sometimes Trogs and the Trolls in Sand Palace just stand there without doing anything. When you move they become activated for a while again. This bug could be caused by the AI timer not properly resetting? 
- The executable binary around 15 mb(!) since last revision? It used to be around 1 mb before....- SetFrame doesnt seem to work properly. (see mosquitoes, they are stuck in one frame)
