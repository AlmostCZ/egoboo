Here is a short list of the know issues in Egoboo that weren't fixed in the last release. There might be other 
issues that weren't detected hidden around the game. If you discover one, please report in in the community forums
at: http://egoboo.sourceforge.net/forum/ 

Thanks!

KNOWN BUGS:
- Rust eaters should somehow suffer slight negative effects when eating a kursed item.
- Need magic sparks for the sporks.
- When the character dies he drops some of his coins. This gold shows abnormal behaviour. Everytime the character jumps the coins jump too. 
- The rune of combat blessing is broken. After casting/activating it almost all life points are drawn. Then the sound is played. Then it seems it stucks in an infinite loop resulting in the spell being cast again and again. When being hold the casting costs divine mana when dropped it doesn't. 
- The rune of confusion is broken. The first time the spell is used there is a purple cloud created for aiming. After using it a second time, there's no cloud displayed. 
- Healer Starter: The necromancer sometimes runs against the brazier resulting in death. 
- The rune of resist elements can't be deactivated. 
- Bishopia: The suspicious mushrooms in Olaf's junkyard can't be picked up. 
- Archmage Trials: After solving the mirror puzzle (with the minotaur) my character gets supersized. 
- Archmage Trials: After fighting the viking an invisible wall blocks my path. So i can't talk to the door. 
- Archmage Trials: The warlock on the cess board (actually only the left one) is attacking the player with magic missiles even when the game hasn't started. 
- In the tourist starter the spike traps are hurting the character even when he doesn't touches them. (They hurt even when standing some steps away...) 
- Seems some objects are being loaded twice into the same slot see -> http://img830.imageshack.us/img830/3996/egoerror.jpg
- Menu interface bug in Linux see -> http://a.imageshack.us/img829/5305/ego11.png
- Particle end effects like "sound" or "spawn other particles" doesn't work.
- Moving particles tend to get stuck in walls.
- Imprisoned One II: After defeating the sand troll there appears no staff.
- The elemental demon can sometimes escape his prison without the locks being opened. This makes him also invincible. He's still attacking the player. 
- To unlock Water palace, it is necessary to finish sand palace . But when I finished sand palace , I do not unlock water palace.
- After being poisoned the green life bar won't turn red again.
- The "fireball/flame ring seems to throw you through the ceiling, while your inventory stays where it was (but is still properly attached)" (I figured out that this seems to be what it does)
- Whips attack to fast. They also no longer spawn the small white flash.
- The green potions found in some chests can't be picked up. 
- With the magic carpet I'm able to fly through doors or even walls. I think the velocity of the carpet is too high. It kinda "drills" through the walls. 
- After killing guards or monsters with bombs a false message is displayed. (eg. "A guard killed a guard." "A sheep butchered a sheep"). Also the guards don't attack the player who set up the bomb. They attack the shepherd or the healer/alchemist. 
- There appears to be some random crash bugs occuring making it difficult to play through the modules.
- Bear Trapped monsters can be moved around when they get bumped by allies.
- It seems there is a relative rare physcis bug that allows AI to move through solid walls.
- Zombi Starter: There was one time where the Necromancer tried to "resurrect" an adventurer and the dead adventurer disappeared. 
- Zombi Starter: I don't like the running animations the zombi have. Is it okay if they're slowed down? 
- Zombi Starter: A crash often occurs in the third room (probably already known). 
- I know of a crash bug that I have never done anything to fix. If you play the game with sound turned off, the game will crash because the in-game music is not loaded and all the pointers are null. For some reason this is not an easy fix, but I can't remember why.
- Elf Starter: The A.I. is a little strange. I saw a Lumpkin, with two claws, running into a wall and swiping madly. Not sure what was going on. This also occurred with a Lumpkin on the left side of the fortress. Possible explanation: they were hostile to the crabs? 
- There is a graphical "hiccup" when you change armor. This also occurs when you transform. 
- When you drop the green spell books, they appear as red. I seem to recall a similar problem in the wizard module. 
- There is no rendering at the bottom of the screen. This appears to be a trick to make the game run more smoothly (which is good), but it looks awkward at times. Is there some way to enlarge the field of view? 
- This is a bit random, but clipping issues occur, making your character unable to receive damage. Perhaps this occurs after loading a module three times. 
- Probably a physics problem, but blood does not dry out very quickly. This is especially noticeable in the Elf module. 
- Soldier Starter:  The chocobone [sic?] will sometimes run towards torches, resulting in suicide. 
- The physics are very sensitive. Coffins will strongly push you away if you touch them closely (sometimes getting you into the blue blobs). As you should see in "ego00.bmp", they can even push you on top of interesting areas. Coins also bounce highly, taking longer to get, but some bounce into the walls.
- The green cube is immune to weapons. Was this intended too? 
- Exploit: You can assassinate characters with bear traps. 
- Identify scrolls don't work 
- As all characters and on any map you sometimes just slowly slide to the left. 
- Particle IfHitGround does not work. 
- The fire breath from the dogs can and will hurt the rider. 
- There seems to be a texture allocation bug when Restarting a module. Some objects get the skins of other objects. 
- There seems to be a random crash bug somewhere. 
- SetFrame doesnt seem to work properly. (see mosquitoes, they are stuck in one frame)

IMPORTANT/OF MEDIUM IMPORTANCE (but still nasty) 
* Dead enemies horribly flicker if they are next to a door or inside a wall. Stepping on such a dead character often freezes the game and finally crashes it. 
* In Sand Palace, the game once froze. The ticker (not the in-game ticker, but the DOS window system report thingy) said "spawn_one_enchant() failed because target was not alive" thrice before it happened. 
* In Ash Palace, Ice Palace and Cobol Palace, the game freezes/crashes very often - without any errors in ticker or log except the occasional "spawn_one_enchant() failed because target [...]". In Ice Palace and Cobol Palace, it even sometimes simply quits without any warning and without the OS noticing anything strange. In Ice Palace, the game especially likes to crash when you are battling the Rust Eater. Which extremely sucks and is demotivating. I had already exterminated all its maggots and severely damaged it thrice... and every time, my efforts were ended by the game either freezing or simply collapsing. Otherwise the fight with the rusty would be so much fun...  
* Shadow Palace (often) and Ice Palace (rarely) get a warning: 
WARN: spawn_one_enchant() - failed because the required enchant owner cannot be found. 
* When you restart a module, skins get messed up horribly. 
* Fireballs either just fly around and simply disappear, or they hit enemies in a way much like a missile - a tiny particle blast and the enemy is damaged. 
* Blud of insects, cockatrices and lumpkins still doesn't despawn. The blud of some others, like mosquitos, trogs or cobols, does, though. 
* Basically, Combat Blessing is extremely buggy. It sometimes sets the users life somewhere next to 0 (empty health bar), though it never kills the user itself. Also, it sometimes puts out torches while charging. Also, the divine light effect it casts is sometimes invisible and it sometimes makes grubs (and others? Haven't tested...) invulnerable to your attacks and you invulnerable to theirs (team change?) 
The problem occured with a 2.7.4 healer with a 2.7.4 rune in 2.8.0, though... not tested with 2.8.0 stuff. 
* After restarting the World Map, the friendly Ulna once could absorb Holy Touch, bump damage (from the Healer skill that deals Holy damage to bumped undead) and combat blessing like a living creature. 
* Items thrown into a shop (e. g. daggers thrown on a chest mimic) are not recognized by the shopkeeper, but he still wants money for them when you want to pick them up again. 
* Missiles cannot bounce off walls anymore; they despawn on first hit instead. 
* If you use the Elf Armor chest in Sand Palace (which contains a tuxedo no matter what you wear when entering the module, btw), it doesn't contain your previous armor afterwards. Coming there with a Dragon Hide means that you're stuck with that stupid Tuxedo, at least for the rest of the module. 
* Petrified trolls are sometimes invulnerable. I don't know if that particular example was already dead and simply didn't poof (the doors opened), but I could damage it neither with a mallet nor with a Ring of Flames spell (that instantly kills it otherwise). 
* After beating a Palace, the quest status isn't saved - [MAIN] in quest.txt is not increased. I had to set it manually to continue. Also, quests you take (Cobol Palace, imprisoned one) don't get their entry in quest.txt. 
* Darkvision skill does not work in Shadow Palace. It is still pitch black. I mostly used missiles for lighting my way... 
* Sporks are not stackable. Wasn't it planned to make them stackable a few months ago? I could imagine that there are troubles with stacking named - and basically just different - objects, though... 
* The Cobol Palace does not unlock even if you read at Sandweg that a secret module would have been unlocked. 
* Whips snap with abnormal speed (~10 snaps per second), at least if wielded by my elf (Dex 28; not tested with others). When wielded by a cobol or any other enemy/NPC, their speed is normal. 
* Identify doesn't properly work - the scroll is always reported as wasted, and the name of the object isn't made known. Tested with the bracelet at Sand Palace and the kursed broadsword of Ice Palace. 
* Stealing does not work - if you grab something while invisible or stealthy, the shopkeeper tells you you would lack the money or takes the price as if you were visible. 
* If you accidentally take off an amulet/a bracelet/shoes, you will often not put them on by putting them away. To activate them again, you often need to drop then and pick them up. 

COSMETIC/TRIVIAL 
* The range of Holy Touch is very wimpy. Even with my 6th level Healer, who reached 1/3 of the screen in 2.7.4, it barely hits someone directly standing in front of her. But unlike when I tried to play the starter a few weeks ago, I didn't cast "Healdouken", as chevkcx called it (Holy Touch is flinged through the whole room)... Have you fixed that bug or does it occur with 2.8.0 healers only? 
* Stealthed characters sometimes look weird - it seems like their head becomes transparent and reveals the back of the character. 
* The game tries to load a module-local gelfeet object file that doesn't exist in the Shadow Palace - must be a relict from the time when a global folder didn't exist. 
* Ghouls in Shadow Palace rise either extremely fast or not at all. 
* If you step on a dead Darkshine Knight, you see a floating message of "Blocked". 
* Hotdog breath hurts the rider. 
* Backstab messages in the ticker are displayed twice. 
* The switch tile in the bumper car module does not work. 
* You can damage bumper cars with missile. 
* You can only move in a single direction while dual wielding (like you can do with katanas or torches). 
* Stalkers in Shadow Palace are not spawned.
* Shuffling Heaps either move extremely fast or very very [...] very slow. 
* Braziers deal damage if you bump into them anywhere, and not just if you bump into the burning part. 
* AI enemies happily jump into lava or freezing water, often killing themself, just to attack me. CoboLemmings? 
* Darkshine knights tend to attack walls until you get in close range to them. 
* The "monster" from Imprisoned One is seemingly able to fly. It flings itself through the room and spams its poison bubbles on you. 
* The Ash Palace Watcher's poison is not stopped by healing. 
* It seems like cobol mages could create ~8 missiles if you don't kill them while they charge. Are they really much more intelligent than my Elf (Int 29, 5 missiles)? 
* Hurting the rust eater often does not create floating text. 
* If you override something with a Strider, the strider is considered the killer. Done on purpose or a bug? 
* Missiles often hit mounts instead of their riders. IMO, they should always home on the riders. 
* Successful magical unlocking always gives out "Nothing seems to happen" plus "The door is already open." 
* Unlocking the door of the Cobol Mage room does not work; you can walk through the - still visible - door after "unlocking" it, but the middle part is not trespassable.
