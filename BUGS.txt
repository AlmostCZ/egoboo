Here is a short list of the know issues in Egoboo that weren't fixed in the last release. There might be other 
issues that weren't detected hidden around the game. If you discover one, please report in in the community forums

Thanks!

KNOWN BUGS:
- Colour changes to the Life Bar through enchantments seem to be permanent. 
- Zombi in Elf Starter has buggy AI. 
- The Paladin spell Call Gelding only works one time. 
- The Divine Rune in Healer Starter cannot be turned off. 
- Slippy walls have to little "slippyness" 
- Spears are dropped one at a time instead of throwing them. 
- I can't jump in rouge starter I just headbang. 
- Once I slaughter half of rouge starter enemies random stuff just starts becoming invisible or just dissappears completely. 
- The iron ball no longer slows me down it just teleports to me whenever the chain is extended. 
- The iron ball deletes from your hands if you walk to fast away from knife if you are holding his iron ball. 
- Your inventory already counts as full if you have 2 passive items in it. (I had a sword in left hand, a book in right hand, another book in inventory and the amulet in inventory too. I wanted to put the book away to take out the other book; the reaction was "Uh-oh!".) 
- Healing Potions (HealTarget script) do not remove poison. 
- There seems to be an AI targeting bug. Sometimes Trogs and the Trolls in Sand Palace just stand there without doing anything. When you move they become activated for a while again. 
- You cannot dismount from the gatling gun in the G'nome Starter 
- The executable binary around 15 mb(!) since last revision? It used to be around 1 mb before.... - Runes need to be repriced much like Arcane Spellbooks were
- SetFrame doesnt seem to work properly. (see mosquitoes, they are stuck in one frame)
