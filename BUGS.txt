Here is a short list of the know issues in Egoboo that weren't fixed in the last release. There might be other 
issues that weren't detected hidden around the game. If you discover one, please report in in the community forums
at: http://egoboo.sourceforge.net/forum/ 

Thanks!

KNOWN BUGS:
- There seems to be an AI targeting bug. Sometimes Trogs and the Trolls in Sand Palace just stand there without doing anything. When you move they become activated for a while again. 
- You cannot dismount from the gatling gun in the G'nome Starter 
- One cannot pick up money. 
- The executable binary is around 15 mb(!) since last revision? It used to be around 1 mb before.... - Enchants on jewlery when module spawns aren't activated.
- Runes need to be repriced much like Arcane Spellbooks were
- Troll in Griffin tower doesnt die properly
- SetFrame doesnt seem to work properly. (see mosquitoes, they are stuck in one frame)
