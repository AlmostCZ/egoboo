Here is a short list of the know issues in Egoboo that weren't fixed in the last release. There might be other 
issues that weren't detected hidden around the game. If you discover one, please report in in the community forums

Thanks!

KNOWN BUGS:
- Moving particles tend to get stuck in walls.
- Bug with beating The Crypt (constant gonging?)
- Imprisoned One II: After defeating the sand troll there appears no staff.
- The elemental demon can sometimes escape his prison without the locks being opened. This makes him also invincible. He's still attacking the player. 
- To unlock Water palace, it is necessary to finish sand palace . But when I finished sand palace , I do not unlock water palace.
- After being poisoned the green life bar won't turn red again.
- The "fireball/flame ring seems to throw you through the ceiling, while your inventory stays where it was (but is still properly attached)" (I figured out that this seems to be what it does)
- Whips attack to fast. They also no longer spawn the small white flash.
- The Abyss II: The chest at the beginning pushes my character through the whole level. 
- The green potions found in some chests can't be picked up. 
- With the magic carpet I'm able to fly through doors or even walls. I think the velocity of the carpet is too high. It kinda "drills" through the walls. 
- After killing guards or monsters with bombs a false message is displayed. (eg. "A guard killed a guard." "A sheep butchered a sheep"). Also the guards don't attack the player who set up the bomb. They attack the shepherd or the healer/alchemist. 
- There appears to be some random crash bugs occuring making it difficult to play through the modules.
- Bear Trapped monsters can be moved around when they get bumped by allies.
- It seems there is a relative rare physcis bug that allows AI to move through solid walls.
- Zombi Starter: There was one time where the Necromancer tried to "resurrect" an adventurer and the dead adventurer disappeared. 
- Zombi Starter: I don't like the running animations the zombi have. Is it okay if they're slowed down? 
- Zombi Starter: A crash often occurs in the third room (probably already known). 
- I know of a crash bug that I have never done anything to fix. If you play the game with sound turned off, the game will crash because the in-game music is not loaded and all the pointers are null. For some reason this is not an easy fix, but I can't remember why.
- Elf Starter:The A.I. is a little strange. I saw a Lumpkin, with two claws, running into a wall and swiping madly. Not sure what was going on. This also occurred with a Lumpkin on the left side of the fortress. Possible explanation: they were hostile to the crabs? 
- There is a graphical "hiccup" when you change armor. This also occurs when you transform. 
- When you drop the green spell books, they appear as red. I seem to recall a similar problem in the wizard module. 
- There is no rendering at the bottom of the screen. This appears to be a trick to make the game run more smoothly (which is good), but it looks awkward at times. Is there some way to enlarge the field of view? 
- This is a bit random, but clipping issues occur, making your character unable to receive damage. Perhaps this occurs after loading a module three times. 
- Probably a physics problem, but blood does not dry out very quickly. This is especially noticeable in the Elf module. 
- Soldier Starter:  The chocobone [sic?] will sometimes run towards torches, resulting in suicide. 
- The physics are very sensitive. Coffins will strongly push you away if you touch them closely (sometimes getting you into the blue blobs). As you should see in "ego00.bmp", they can even push you on top of interesting areas. Coins also bounce highly, taking longer to get, but some bounce into the walls.
- The tranch can be killed without breaking the idol it is in. 
- The green cube is immune to weapons. Was this intended too? 
- Exploit: You can assassinate characters with bear traps. 
- Identify scrolls don't work 
- As all characters and on any map you sometimes just slowly slide to the left. 
- Particle IfHitGround does not work. 
- The fire breath from the dogs can and will hurt the rider. 
- There seems to be a texture allocation bug when Restarting a module. Some objects get the skins of other objects. 
- There seems to be a random crash bug somewhere. 
- SetFrame doesnt seem to work properly. (see mosquitoes, they are stuck in one frame)
