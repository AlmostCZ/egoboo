Here is a short list of the know issues in Egoboo that weren't fixed in the last release. There might be other 
issues that weren't detected hidden around the game. If you discover one, please report in in the community forums
at: http://egoboo.sourceforge.net/forum/ 

Thanks!


KNOWN BUGS:
- Some Script Errors were reported in the Abyss 2. 
- not saving in Bishopia
- and i've been in zippy village and there are some potions in the ground... Speed, invisibility and a green one 
- the green plant in the wizard module cannot be picked up. 
- The physics are very sensitive. Coffins will strongly push you away if you touch them closely (sometimes getting you into the blue blobs). As you should see in "ego00.bmp", they can even push you on top of interesting areas. Coins also bounce highly, taking longer to get, but some bounce into the walls. Flaming skulls are also very sensitive to hit. 
- The tranch can be killed without breaking the idol it is in. 
- The green cube is immune to weapons. Was this intended too? 
- Are healing potions suppose to remove posion? They do not cure you. 
- Rebith scrolls can resurrect enemies 
- Exploit: You can assassinate characters with bear traps. 
- Identify scrolls don't work 
- As all characters and on any map you sometimes just slowly slide to the left. 
- Particle IfHitGround does not work. 
- The fire breath from the dogs can and will hurt the rider. 
- Ash Palace: Seems much darker than it was originally. 
- There seems to be a texture allocation bug when Restarting a module. Some objects get the skins of other objects. 
- the normal people you fight seem to want to sit in the pot as if it was a normal moving mount. 
- There seems to be a random crash bug somewhere. 
- SetFrame doesnt seem to work properly. (see mosquitoes, they are stuck in one frame)
