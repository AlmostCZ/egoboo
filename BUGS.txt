Here is a short list of the know issues in Egoboo that weren't fixed in the last release. There might be other 
issues that weren't detected hidden around the game. If you discover one, please report in in the community forums

Thanks!

KNOWN BUGS:
- There seems to be a texture allocation bug when Restarting a module. Some objects get the skins of other objects. 
- the normal people you fight seem to want to sit in the pot as if it was a normal moving mount. 
- torches no longer produce fire, just smoke. 
- the evil paladin in Soldier Start walks much faster than you. 
- Movement animation speed is incorrect at times. (Jungle Warriors are a good example!) 
- There seems to be a random crash bug somewhere. 
- Once I slaughter half of rouge starter enemies random stuff just starts becoming invisible or just dissappears completely. 
- There seems to be an AI targeting bug. Sometimes Trogs and the Trolls in Sand Palace just stand there without doing anything. When you move they become activated for a while again. This bug could be caused by the AI timer not properly resetting? 
- The executable binary around 15 mb(!) since last revision? It used to be around 1 mb before....
- SetFrame doesnt seem to work properly. (see mosquitoes, they are stuck in one frame)
