MASTER TODO LIST:
- Spellbooks not being spellbooks when spawning instead of dropped.
- Wizards cannot use lamps
- Overlay effects do not spawn in pits (or is it background?).
- The Bishopia walls should be flagged as a Wall, not as Impassable.
- The Lich boss in the Wizard starter causes the game to freeze sometimes after 2 minutes.
- And becoming bad guy in Zippy and Sand Weg should not export unless you escape. Maybe save
  the aggression in quest.txt for later returns? 
- After passing a module game seems to reset quest progress. It is restored by going back to previous menu, so it is not very significant.
- Sand Troll in Sand Palace seems to get stuck on the pyramid in new physics system. (We might need a FindPath algorithm here) 
- Enchants don't properly increase size when less than 1.00
- also i found a bug, equipping jewelry doesn't always bestow enchant on user, i had much trouble with amulet on strength it seemed to 
  work 1 on 4 tries, weird (tires of throwing away and grabbing back)
- Halve mana loss caused by potions
- Enchant end sounds doesnt work
- Runes need to be repriced much like Arcane Spellbooks were
  
ABYSS 2
- Elayne should not like zombor
