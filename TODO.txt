MASTER TODO LIST:
- Brainscrambler daze ray doesnt work and Gonne shots do not hit, these two are probably related
  (Probably Max Speed that causes a lot of particle problems)
- Exporting no longer works.
- Enchants do not work properly.
- Enchants on jewlery when module spawns aren't activated.
- Runes need to be repriced much like Arcane Spellbooks were
- Troll in Griffin tower doesnt die properly
- SetFrame doesnt seem to work properly. (see mosquitoes, they are stuck in one frame)
- You can no longer turn around while holding a shield
- The Bishopia walls should be flagged as a Wall, not as Impassable.
