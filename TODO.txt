MASTER TODO LIST:
- Spellbooks not being spellbooks when spawning instead of dropped.
- Wizards cannot use lamps
- Runes crushed messages are missing
- The ice in the Ice Palace is VERY slippery...
- Squidgies still messing things up!
- Crusader shield IfPutAway not working. It also refills mana!
- Overlay effects do not spawn in pits.
- The Bishopia walls should be flagged as a Wall, not as Impassable.
- The Lich boss in the Wizard starter causes the game to freeze sometimes after 2 minutes.
- Becoming the bad guy in Bishopia should still allow you to escape and export somehow.

ABYSS 2
- Rustproof weapon for elayne
- Elayne should not like zombor
