KNOWN BUGS:
- There seems to be an AI targeting bug. Sometimes Trogs and the Trolls in Sand Palace just stand
  there without doing anything. When you move they become activated for a while again.
- You cannot dismount from the gatling gun in the G'nome Starter
- Coins from the chest mimic seem to disappear when dropped.
- Invictus from shields and animation frames seem not to work anymore. (i.e shields do not work!)
- Brainscrambler daze ray doesnt work and Gonne shots do not hit, these two are probably related
  (Probably Max Speed that causes a lot of particle problems). Also noticed that arrows from the x-bow
  hit the ground pretty quick, making it a short range weapon.
- You can no longer turn around while holding a shield
- Enchants on jewlery when module spawns aren't activated.
- Runes need to be repriced much like Arcane Spellbooks were
- Troll in Griffin tower doesnt die properly
- SetFrame doesnt seem to work properly. (see mosquitoes, they are stuck in one frame)
- The Bishopia walls should be flagged as a Wall, not as Impassable.
