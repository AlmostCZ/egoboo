MASTER TODO LIST:
- Spellbooks not being spellbooks when spawning instead of dropped.
- Wizards cannot use lamps
- Runes crushed messages are missing
- Overlay effects do not spawn in pits.
- The Bishopia walls should be flagged as a Wall, not as Impassable.
- The Lich boss in the Wizard starter causes the game to freeze sometimes after 2 minutes.
- And becoming bad guy in Zippy and Sand Weg should not export unless you escape. Maybe save
  the aggression in quest.txt for later returns? 
- Enchanting potions while doesn't crash module they were enchanted on, they when being taken out crash other module.
- After passing a module game seems to reset quest progress. It is restored by going back to previous menu, so it is not very significant.
- Sand Troll in Sand Palace seems to get stuck on the pyramid in new physics system. (We might need a FindPath algorithm here) 

ABYSS 2
- Rustproof weapon for elayne
- Elayne should not like zombor
