MASTER TODO LIST:
- Spellbooks not being spellbooks when spawning instead of dropped.
- The Bishopia walls should be flagged as a Wall, not as Impassable.
- Sand Troll in Sand Palace seems to get stuck on the pyramid in new physics system. (We might need a FindPath algorithm here)
- also i found a bug, equipping jewelry doesn't always bestow enchant on user, i had much trouble with amulet on strength it seemed to 
  work 1 on 4 tries, weird (tires of throwing away and grabbing back)
- Runes need to be repriced much like Arcane Spellbooks were
- Troll in Griffin tower doesnt die properly
- Rare crash bug with Tile Mimics in Sand Palace
- Healing cloud for Paladin and Healer is backwards
- The Jive Elf is no longer loaded properly
- Something is messing up the waypoints. In Tourist Starter platforms no longer move.
- Lightning bugs
- Brainscrambler daze ray doesnt work and Gonne shots do not hit, these two are probably related
- Screenshots dont work
- SetFrame doesnt seem to work properly. (see mosquitoes)
