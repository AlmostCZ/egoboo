MASTER TODO LIST:
- Spellbooks not being spellbooks when spawning instead of dropped.
- The Bishopia walls should be flagged as a Wall, not as Impassable.
- After passing a module game seems to reset quest progress. It is restored by going back to previous menu, so it is not very significant.
- Sand Troll in Sand Palace seems to get stuck on the pyramid in new physics system. (We might need a FindPath algorithm here) 
- Enchants don't properly increase size when less than 1.00
- also i found a bug, equipping jewelry doesn't always bestow enchant on user, i had much trouble with amulet on strength it seemed to 
  work 1 on 4 tries, weird (tires of throwing away and grabbing back)
- Halve mana/life loss caused by potions
- Runes need to be repriced much like Arcane Spellbooks were
- Platforms in Abyss don't work properly, for some time they lift normally, then give a pretty massive boost thus throwing into the void. 
- If I start bishopia city or forgotten fortress comes only the text: press escape for quit.
- The position of the end text when you finish a module is wrong
