MASTER TODO LIST:
- Spellbooks not being spellbooks when spawning instead of dropped.
- The Bishopia walls should be flagged as a Wall, not as Impassable.
- Sand Troll in Sand Palace seems to get stuck on the pyramid in new physics system. (We might need a FindPath algorithm here)
- also i found a bug, equipping jewelry doesn't always bestow enchant on user, i had much trouble with amulet on strength it seemed to 
  work 1 on 4 tries, weird (tires of throwing away and grabbing back)
- Runes need to be repriced much like Arcane Spellbooks were
- Troll in Griffin tower doesnt die properly
- Rare crash bug with Tile Mimics in Sand Palace
- Game crashes when using specific texture filter modes and billboards.
- Spellbooks burn when dropped
- Boulders in tourist starter did not move.
