MASTER TODO LIST:
- Spellbooks not being spellbooks when spawning instead of dropped.
- The Bishopia walls should be flagged as a Wall, not as Impassable.
- Sand Troll in Sand Palace seems to get stuck on the pyramid in new physics system. (We might need a FindPath algorithm here)
- also i found a bug, equipping jewelry doesn't always bestow enchant on user, i had much trouble with amulet on strength it seemed to 
  work 1 on 4 tries, weird (tires of throwing away and grabbing back)
- Runes need to be repriced much like Arcane Spellbooks were
- Troll in Griffin tower doesnt die properly
- Rare crash bug with Tile Mimics in Sand Palace

- Healing cloud for Paladin and Healer is backwards
- The Jive Elf is no longer loaded properly
- Something is messing up the waypoints. In Tourist Starter platforms no longer move.
- Lightning bugs (Areas of strong darkness still appear and stay until you bring a light source)
- Brainscrambler daze ray doesnt work and Gonne shots do not hit, these two are probably related
- SetFrame doesnt seem to work properly. (see mosquitoes, they are stuck in one frame)
- Shields held in right hand look buggy
- You can no longer turn around while holding a shield
- A very irritating bug where defence pings spawn for almost everything that hits something. A lit lamp that hits a portal for example.
- Offensive stuff can no longer friendly fire. If they hit stuff it will simply spawn a defence ping and bounce like it was deflected.
  Same with hitting invulnerable stuff like a pillar or table.
- Certain objects with a bump radius seem to hit stuff when dropped, being held, etc... the torch for example.
