MASTER TODO LIST:
- Spellbooks not being spellbooks when spawning instead of dropped.
- Wizards cannot use lamps
- Runes crushed messages are missing
- Exploding oil when taken out? (lit lamp was held in other hand)
- Minimize on Linux can cause textures to be buggy.
- Impassable tile in Zippy? (near healer) (and forgotten fortress?)
- The ice in the Ice Palace is VERY slippery...
- Squidgies still messing things up!
- Crusader shield IfPutAway not working. It also refills mana!
- Overlay effects do not spawn in pits.
- Restoration removes good buffs
- A bug in the waypoint system, causing such as:
  Creates in G'nome starter tend to wander uphill.
  Brom and Mim in the adventurer starter have some strange sudden waypoints.
- Exp cheat works waaay to fast.
- shield of deflection not working vs. orbstorm and float eye attacks
- Game crashes in sand palace. Mimic and tranch room. (Only on specific pc's?) 
- The Bishopia walls should be flagged as a Wall, not as Impassable.
- The Lich boss in the Wizard starter causes the game to freeze sometimes after 2 minutes.
- Becoming the bad guy in Bishopia should still allow you to escape and export somehow.
- When healers use potion or Regeneration rune, their life change from "mana life" to normal "red life" 
- Equipped enchants (boots, amulets, etc.) seem to go away if user dies and respawns. 

ABYSS 2
- Rustproof weapon for elayne
- New weapon for darkie boss?
- Elayne should not like zombor
- Add another npc? (wizard? rogue - read'n detect?)
