- Spellbooks not being spellbooks when spawning instead of dropped.
- Wizards cannot use lamps
- Runes crushed messages are missing
- Exploding oil when taken out? (lit lamp was held in other hand)
- Minimize on Linux can cause textures to be buggy.
- Impassable tile in Zippy? (near healer) (and forgotten fortress?)
- There are white stools in the Wizard Starter, the skins are still messed up for various thing sometimes.

- The Bishopia walls should be flagged as a Wall, not as Impassable.
- Brom and Mim in the adventurer starter have some strange sudden waypoints.
- The Lich boss in the Wizard starter causes the game to freeze sometimes after 2 minutes.
- Becoming the bad guy in Bishopia should still allow you to escape and export somehow.

- The Missile spell (aquired from the Adventurer Starter) isn't homing anymore at all, even if standing right in front of the target.
- Equipped enchants (boots, amulets, etc.) seem to go away if user dies and respawns.
