		Proposal<br /><br/>
		This are the descriptions for the different types of characters in EGOBOO<br />
		The data structs are given in XML<br />
        The <b>effects</b> are at the heart of the matter:<br />
        - Items have effects<br />
        - Monster-attacks have effects<br />
        - Spells have effects<br />
		<br />
	    Effects can be temporary or permanent<br />
		<br />
		Tag: &lt;effect&gt;
